Don’t sweat it! In the dev world, a "Work in Progress" (WIP) project is often better than no project at all. It shows you are currently coding and solving problems.

The secret is all in how you present it. If a recruiter clicks your GitHub and sees a half-finished project with no explanation, they might think you gave up. If they see a project with a "Roadmap," they think you are a professional planner.

Here is how to handle your incomplete project for the King Price application:

1. The "Roadmap" Strategy (Fix your README)
In your GitHub README, don’t apologize for it being unfinished. Instead, show your plan. This proves you understand the "Full Stack" lifecycle.

Add a "Status" section to your README:

🚧 Project Status: In Development
This portal is currently being built to demonstrate secure authentication and API handling.

Completed Features:

✅ User Registration logic with password hashing (Bcrypt).

✅ Backend API routing using Node.js & Express.

✅ JWT Token generation on login.

Next Up (Roadmap):

🏗️ Connecting Frontend dashboard to Backend API.

🏗️ Implementing "Forgot Password" email flow.

🏗️ Database integration for policy document storage.

2. Focus on the "Brains" (The Backend)
For a company like King Price, the security and logic are more important than a pretty button. Even if your CSS looks messy or the dashboard is empty, make sure your Server-side code is clean.

Make sure your package.json is organized.

Make sure your folder structure looks professional.# member
